# Understanding Apps

Apps — sometimes called *integrations*, *services*, or *third-party applications* — are modular components that extend the platform without being part of its core codebase.

## Why Apps?
- **Automation**: Reduce manual tasks and streamline workflows.
- **Integration**: Connect external systems (CRMs, support tools, monitoring).
- **Customization**: Tailor the platform to your team’s needs.
