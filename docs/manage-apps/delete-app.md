In the app:

1. Select *Settings*, then select *Manage team* or go to [teams.wire.com](https://teams.wire.com/).

Deleting an app is permanent. The App ID and authentication token will be invalidated and can’t be restored.  
To continue using the integration, you’ll need to create a new app
and update your code with the new credentials.
