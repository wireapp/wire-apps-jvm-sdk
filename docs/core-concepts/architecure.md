## How Apps Work
Apps are separate pieces of software that communicate with the platform’s frontend and backend through a **common protocol** (such as APIs or events).  
They remain independent, but can seamlessly interact with the system and its users.

An **App** is a way to extend and automate your team’s experience on Wire].
Apps can listen to messages, send responses, and integrate with external services.

Apps are owned and managed at the **team level**, giving administrators control over:
- Which Apps can be installed
- What data Apps can access
